Use JS for game functionality

- html input for "word" and number for the leader

- add in ability for user to assign the leader each game

- only leader can see a board with colors revealed


- onClick function for table cells
    - display color/bystander/assassin
    if right guess
      - allow turn to continue if still allowed
      - change cards_left count
      - change cards_guessed count
      - if turn is over switch to other team's turn
    if bystander
      - end turn / switch to other team
    if assassin
      - end game
      - assign winner as the other team


  Extras: timers??

  - look at TTT JS lab for examples
